Client Pitch:
Targeted Oviposition Control for Spotted Lanternflies
Team: Team NYC | Client(s): Cornell CALS Extension / E&J Gallo Winery / National Grape
Problem Statement
Spotted Lanternflies randomly disperse and lay their eggs on a multitude of surfaces, including
vehicles, allowing them to be easily transported and spread to new places. Current solutions to the SLF
invasion reduce current adult density in locations of interest, such as vineyards. However, this
superficial approach does not address the new generations of eggs, each mass containing
approximately 30 to 50 eggs, waiting to hatch. The core problem lies in SLF oviposition being
unregulated, allowing new infestations to persist despite local control efforts. The dispersal of eggs is
regulated through post-oviposition elimination, which is too large in scale to be consistently effective.
Impact
Targeting the consolidation of SLF egg masses would introduce a mechanism aimed at reducing
infestation as a whole, rather than just redirecting populations away from their current hosts. This
would not only mitigate the problem at its source but also substantially reduce the labor required for
scouting and scraping egg masses. Therefore, by addressing unconstrained oviposition, this approach
could limit continued reinfestation and the resulting economic and ecological damage.
Proposed direction
We will implement a device that intermittently emits high concentrations of oils such as tea tree,
peppermint, or lavender before oviposition so that “no lay zones” are created. This would redirect
adults from laying eggs in protected sensitive zones and towards designated areas where they can be
monitored and destroyed. We would
● Install multiple devices with 10-25 feet between each one from July to December
● Conduct routine population counts outside of the 5-10 foot radius of each device to measure
adult activity and inspect for eggs beginning in September
● Routinely destroy egg masses through the early spring
Instead of finding a method to eliminate the adult population, by redirecting where they can lay their
eggs, we can aggregate them and more effectively destroy them. Most current approaches target the
adult population, however, by targeting oviposition we reduce the next generation compounding over
time. We can feasibly develop and test an aerosol repellent module that delivers short bursts of
essential oils to repel SLF from vineyards and into controlled egg-laying zones.
Key risks/unknowns
● Environmental Variability— Wind, rain, and other environmental factors can alter how any
airborne particle interacts with its environment. We would aim to optimize an aerosol delivery
determining the minimum effective concentration required under varying environmental
conditions, while also evaluating drift, deposition patterns, and stability over time.
● Population Redistribution — Concentrating SLF into designated zones requires careful
planning and treatment to avoid inadvertently worsening the problem. We would need to
survey the density of SLF in the surrounding area before deployment to ensure that it does not
increase in these untreated zones.
Questions for the client
● Where are egg masses most commonly found in and around your vineyards (specific surfaces
and materials)?
Decision affected: Surface texture design and deployment location.
● When is the most critical deployment window before oviposition begins?
Decision affected: Timing, release duration, and refill interval.
● Are there restrictions on chemical compounds or odors near grape production areas?
Decision affected: Selection of deterrent or attractant compounds.
